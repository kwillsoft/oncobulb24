What is oncoBULB?<br>
oncoBULB is an information-based application that allows students, doctors, patients, caregivers, and holistic wellness
 practitioners to view summaries of the latest medical literature regarding herbal therapies for each of the most prevalent
  cancer types in the US.  Simply select a cancer type and on the corresponding page select "GET THE DATA".  You will then see up to 
  20 plant-based studies related to the chosen cancer type.

What can I do with this information?<br>
(1) In each article, (after the publication name, date, and author info) you'll find the particular plant or plant extract studied. (2) Use Google to find the common name of the plant. (3) Independently research the historical uses of the plant/herb on other websites. (4)Take these findings to your wellness provider, herbalist, naturopath or instructor for further advice & historical use cases.
